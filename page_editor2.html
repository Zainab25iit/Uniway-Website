        <h2>Comments Page</h2>
        <p>*I developed a comment form to collect user feedback on their use of our website and to send user input to our website email.
        </p>
        <p>*Javascript and CSS were used to check user inputs on the comment form and display error warnings when required fields were left blank.
        </p>
        <p>*Different stylistic effects have been applied to input fields that react to invalid inputs.
        </p>
        <p>*created a thank you screen that shows once a comment form is successfully submitted.
        </p>
        <p>*To allow users to return to the completed form, a back to form button was added to the thank you screen.</p>
